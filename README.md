How to create php extension with zephir

For example:

#### Time-Dependent Schrodinger Equantion(Theory)

We model an electron initially localized in space at x = 5 whit momentum $k_0$ (constan plank  $\hbar =1$ ) by a Gaussian wave function multiplying a plane wawe:

> $\psi(x,t=0) = exp[(-1/2((x-5)/ \sigma_0)^2)]exp(ik_0x)$

Your problem is to determine the wave function for all later times. The behavior of this wave packet when confined to an harmonic oscillator potential
